His tech background is Support, Training, Project & Team Management for 40+ years.  Novation, Apple, Tandem/Compaq, a couple of startups and now GM of a consulting firm.

At one point he could answer any question on any Apple product - of course the list of products was pretty short then.

Been riding for about 40 years (off and on), too.

Joined Sons in 2015 or so.

Web-master and Discord-master, Ben has been riding with Sons for a few years now.  Bikes have included:

* Yamaha FZ-07
* Kawasaki Ninja 650
* Kawasaki ZX-6R
* Yamaha MT-09 SP
* Aprilia Tuareg 660

He likes twisty roads, going fast on track, and will be going offroad shortly, so we'll see if he likes that too!
