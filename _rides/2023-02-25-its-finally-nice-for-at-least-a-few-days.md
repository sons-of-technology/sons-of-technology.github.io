So, the weather was nice for a few days.  Saturday looked like it would start a little cool but warm up.

We get to Radio Coffee and... it's chilly.  40s and the sun was just not coming out.

We wait around for a little bit, hoping it'd warm up and it did, but not as much as anyone would have liked.

Some people bowed out, but others decided to continue.

Let me tell you, it was a chilly ride!  We stopped partway through the Willow City Loop for pics and to warm up a little bit.

By the time we got to Hondo's for lunch, the weather was perfect.

We split up into smaller groups for the ride back and a few of us discovered a muddy, gravel road.  It would have been amazing to ride if I brought my ADV bike, but this was the first time I had ridden my MT-09 SP in _months_ and it got nice and muddy.  It was still a ton of fun though.

We all had an awesome ride, but I promise Don to never comment on the weather before a ride again.
