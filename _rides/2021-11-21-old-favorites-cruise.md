Organized by JB: 

> Let's do an easy day cruise with some of our old favorite routes.  Kickstands up about 9:30 or so, whenever.  Head out Cesar Chavez to Lake Austin Blvd, Scenic Dr and over to Mount Bonnell Rd, out 2222 to Lime Creek.  Eventually we'll get to 1431.  We can grab some grubs at Copperhead Grill in Lago Vista.  Optional: We can take off from there, or we can hit Cow Creek Loop first.
