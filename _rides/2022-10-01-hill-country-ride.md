excerpt: Finally starting to cool off in Austin

---

Jake organized this one after a rather warm summer in Austin

> The weather is good now, and it's time to start getting rides back on the schedule. This weekend we're kicking things off with a big ride out to Fredericksburg to grab lunch at Hondo's.
We'll head south on 290 to 71, pick up Hamilton Pool, connect via some pretty backroads to the Willow City Loop, then drop down into Fredericksburg for lunch.
You can split off from there, or follow me back to town on some other twisty roads.
