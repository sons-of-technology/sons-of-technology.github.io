excerpt: Finally starting to cool off in Austin

---

Jake organized this one after a rather warm summer in Austin

> The weather is good now, and it's time to start getting rides back on the schedule. This weekend we're kicking things off with a big ride out to Fredericksburg to grab lunch at Hondo's.

> Meet at Radio Coffee at 9 (or earlier if you want food), KSU at 9:30.

> We'll head south on 290 to 71, pick up Hamilton Pool, connect via some pretty backroads to the Willow City Loop, then drop down into Fredericksburg for lunch.

> You can split off from there, or follow me back to town on some other twisty roads.
